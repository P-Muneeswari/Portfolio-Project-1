# 🎬 Project History Through Movies

Welcome to my unique portfolio where I tell the story of my development journey through the lens of cinema! Each project represents a milestone in my coding adventure, framed as a movie that shaped my skills and perspective.

## 🎥 The Concept

Just like movies take us through different genres, emotions, and transformations, my projects represent different phases of my growth as a developer. From the early "short films" of simple websites to the "blockbuster" full-stack applications, each project has its own story, challenges, and triumphs.
